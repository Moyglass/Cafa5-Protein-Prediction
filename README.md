Here are some notebooks that I have submitted as part of a Kaggle machine learning project: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cafa-5-protein-function-prediction/overview
I entered the competition as part of my MSc in Software Design with Artificial Intelligence
The goal of the competition was to predict the functions of various proteins using Machine learning techniques
I started with Eploratory data analysis(EDA) followed by "Cafa5-Esm2 embed + pytorch" which I submitted and the final notebook "CAFA5 Blend embeds - Pytorch 77545" experimenting with different techniques
**TODO** Add descriptions of each notebook
